# Predicting Bike Rentals

Many American cities have communal bike sharing stations where you can rent bicycles by the hour or day. 
Washington, D.C. is one of these cities. 
The District collects detailed data on the number of bicycles people rent by the hour and day.

This project will aim to predict the number of bike rentals using Random Forest Regressor. Model was tuned using RandomizedSearchCV and interpreted using treeinterpreter.
